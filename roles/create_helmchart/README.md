# Automate creation, update and attach of the Helm Chart Certification Project

This new role `create_helmchart` leverages some existing tasks from the create_certification_project role, promoting reusability and avoiding duplication of effort. Additionally, it introduces new tasks, such as check_if_helmchart_project_exists_same_org and update_helmchart_project, to accomplish specific requirements related to Helm Chart certification.

The associated templates, like create_project_helmchart.json.j2, update_project_helmchart_setting.json.j2 and attach_product_helmchart_listing.json.j2, are now stored within the create_certification_project role instead of being duplicated in the new role create_helmchart. This design ensures efficiency, maintainability, and consistency across the roles.

The current backend behavior for attaching a product listing to newly created cert projects requires that the <old_certs_list> and <new_cert_list> be included. This is because the product listing ID may have been used in both the old and new projects. To address this, we implemented an enhancement to query all old cert projects based on the product listing ID that was used in both lists. We then merged the results into a single array and attached the product listing ID to all of the cert projects.

## Global Variables
As the new role `create_helmchart` reuses some existing tasks such as check_for_existing_projects, create_project and attach_product_listings. Please refer to the description in the `create_certification_project` role for information on the shared global variables.


## Variables to define under cert_settings for Helm Chart

## Variables to define for each helmchart_to_certify

A list of Product Listings; all of them must be created beforehand [See doc](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/red-hat-partner-connect-general-guide/managing-your-account/product-listing). It could contain one or many PLs. If set, it will attach all PLs to both old and new certification projects.
